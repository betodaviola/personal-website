          <p>Roberto Mochetti is a viola player, teacher, arranger, and composer. Passionate about experimental and contemporary music, he has played, studied, and taught in Brazil, the United States, and Denmark.</p>
          <p>Born in Brazil, Roberto started his studies of viola at the Conservatory of Amparo, where he had lessons with Adriana Daldosso Belli, Elazir Martins de Lima and Valdeci Merquiori.</p>
          <p>In 2011, while graduating in the conservatory, Roberto earned a scholarship at the undergraduate program of the State University of Campinas (Brazil), to study with Dr. Emerson De Biaggi. During this course, Mochetti assisted in the research <i>Extended Technique For Viola: Research and Suggestions for Study of the Repertoire found at the CDMC/Unicamp Library</i>, and <i>Viola XXI: Adaptation of the Violoncelo XXI for Viola</i>, both with support from the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and led by Dr. Emerson Luis de Biaggi.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Roberto attended the <i>2nd International Symposium of New Music and Computer Music</i> in Curitiba (Brazil), and the <i>5th Festival Música das Esferas</i> in Bragança Paulista (Brazil).</p>
          <p>After completing his bachelor's degree at the University of Campinas in 2015, Roberto moved to Louisiana to study chamber music and performance with the professor James Alexander at the Nicholls State University conservatory program from 2016 to 2018.</p>
          <p>In 2018, Roberto was invited to play at the opening concert for the <i>New Music for Strings</i> festival in Denmark, with the Danish group Ensemble Edge. In the program, he played the World Premiere of the piece <i>Coalescence</i>, for mixed choir and string quartet, by Alan Hankers. Roberto also stayed until the end of the festival to participate as a composer and viola player, performing chamber music and with the string orchestra.</p>
          <p>In 2020, Roberto Mochetti completed his M.M. at Bowling Green State University (Ohio) under the studio of Mr. Matthew McBride-Daline. During the course of this degree, Mochetti was the section leader for the BG Philharmonia under the conducting of Dr. Emily Freeman Brown, and member of the BGSU Graduate String Quartet. He performed with different ensembles during the 39th and 40th editions of the <i>Bowling Green New Music Festival</i>, and worked as a chamber music coach at the <i>BGSU String Summer Camp</i> in 2019.</p>
          <p>Roberto has also taken masterclasses with performers such as Eugene Drucker, Mari Kimura, Steven Dann, Alicia Marie Valoti, Paul Kantor, and Joanna Hood, both focusing on his solo repertoire and with chamber music groups.</p>
          <p>Today, Roberto is working on his <abbr title="Doctor of Musical Arts">DMA</abbr> in viola performance, with a minor in experimental music, under the guidance of Dr. Kimberly Sparr and Dr. Jesse Allison at the Louisiana State University</p>
